            Explaining how large language models (LLMs) like me work to someone with a sociology background can be done by drawing parallels with human social interactions and learning processes. Here's how I would explain it:
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Imagine you're teaching sociology to a group of students. Over time, you observe patterns in how they respond to different teaching styles, the kinds of questions they ask, and the discussions they have. Similarly, LLMs learn patterns, but instead of from classroom discussions, they learn from a massive dataset of text—books, articles, conversations, and more.
        </p>
        <h2>Key Concepts:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Learning Process:</strong> Think of an LLM as a student who learns from a giant "library" of human knowledge. This learning process is guided by mathematics and involves recognizing patterns in how words and ideas are connected. It’s similar to how sociologists look for patterns in human behavior or social interactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Neural Networks:</strong> The LLM uses a neural network, which is like a web of interconnected "neurons" (mathematical units). These neurons help it make connections between words and ideas, much like how people connect concepts like "family" and "society" in sociology.</li>
            <li><strong>Context and Prediction:</strong> When you ask me a question, I predict the next word or sentence based on the patterns I’ve learned. This is akin to how we predict someone's reaction in a social setting based on past experiences.</li>
            <li><strong>Scale:</strong> What makes LLMs "large" is the sheer amount of data and the complexity of the network. Imagine trying to analyze the social behaviors of not just one group but millions of groups worldwide—that’s the level of complexity LLMs handle.</li>
            <li><strong>Fine-Tuning:</strong> Just like a sociology teacher might adjust their teaching style based on their students, LLMs can be fine-tuned to specialize in certain tasks or industries, using additional focused training.</li>
            <li><strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong> LLMs can reflect biases present in the data they are trained on, much like how societal norms and structures can influence individuals' behaviors and attitudes. This is why ethical considerations are critical in their development and use.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            By thinking of LLMs as "students of human language and behavior," it becomes easier to understand how they process, predict, and generate responses—much like how sociologists study and interpret human societies.

        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <div class="faq">
            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer('faq1')">1. Can AI replace humans?</p>
                <div class="faq-answer" id="faq1">
                    No, AI complements humans rather than replacing them. It excels at repetitive or data-heavy tasks but lacks creativity, emotional intelligence, and critical thinking—traits unique to humans.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <p class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer('faq2')">2. Why does AI sometimes reflect bias?</p>
                <div class="faq-answer" id="faq2">
                    AI learns from human-created data, which may contain biases. If the data is skewed, AI will mirror those biases, such as gender or racial stereotypes.

                    AI powers search engines, social media algorithms, virtual assistants like Siri, and even online shopping recommendations. It’s everywhere!
